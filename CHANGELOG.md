# Changelog

## v1.3.0

### bdfs observability and recovery improvements

- **`bdfs-remount-all` writeback restore**: blend namespaces are now remounted with `--writeback` when `cache_mode=writeback` is recorded in `shares.state`; previously writeback cache was silently dropped after reboot
- **`bdfs-remount-all` blend state restore**: after successfully remounting a blend namespace, the ephemeral `blend-*.state` file is recreated in `/run/iwt/bdfs/`; `bdfs-status` now correctly shows blend namespaces as mounted post-reboot recovery
- **`bdfs-install-units --help`**: no longer falls through to `die`; prints usage and exits 0
- **`_install_blend_mount_template` unified**: delegates to `cmd_install_blend_template` instead of maintaining a separate copy of the unit content; eliminates the `ExecStartPost` writeback bug (missing `--btrfs-uuid`/`--dwarfs-uuid`) that silently failed via `|| true`

### bdfs hardening

- **`bdfs-blend-persist`**: replaced broken `.mount` unit with a proper `Type=oneshot` service using the new `iwt-bdfs-blend-mount@.service` template; per-instance UUIDs supplied via drop-in `Environment=` files
- **`iwt-bdfs-blend-mount@.service`**: parameterized template unit (instantiated via `systemd-escape --path`) with `After=bdfs_daemon.service`; installed by `bdfs-install-units` and `bdfs-blend-persist add`
- **`shares.state` persistence**: moved from `/run/iwt/bdfs/` (tmpfs, lost on reboot) to `/var/lib/iwt/bdfs/`; blend state files remain ephemeral in `/run/iwt/bdfs/`; new `IWT_BDFS_STATE_DIR` config var
- **`bdfs-share` deduplication**: rejects duplicate `vm+share` registrations with a clear remediation message
- **`bdfs-remount-all` full auto-recovery**: uses stored UUIDs to remount dropped blend namespaces before re-attaching virtiofs devices; post-reboot recovery is now zero-touch for shares registered with UUID data
- **`bdfs-install-units`**: also installs the `iwt-bdfs-blend-mount@.service` template alongside `iwt-bdfs-remount-all.service`
- **Integration tests**: stub-based scaffold covering `bdfs-share` deduplication, `remount-all` with/without UUIDs, `list-shares` state parsing, and `bdfs-check` output

## v1.2.0

### bdfs — BTRFS+DwarFS Hybrid Storage

Integrates [btrfs-dwarfs-framework](https://github.com/Interested-Deving-1896/btrfs-dwarfs-framework)
as an optional storage backend that blends a writable BTRFS upper layer with
read-only DwarFS lower layers into a unified namespace.

**Core operations** (`iwt vm storage bdfs-*`):
- `bdfs-partition add/remove/list/show` — register and manage bdfs partitions
- `bdfs-blend mount/umount` — mount/unmount the BTRFS+DwarFS blend namespace
- `bdfs-export` — export a BTRFS subvolume to a compressed DwarFS image
- `bdfs-import` — import a DwarFS image back into a BTRFS subvolume
- `bdfs-snapshot` — CoW snapshot of a DwarFS image container
- `bdfs-promote` — make a DwarFS-backed path writable (extract to BTRFS)
- `bdfs-demote` — compress a BTRFS subvolume into a DwarFS image
- `bdfs-status` — show partition and blend status
- `bdfs-daemon start/stop/status` — manage `bdfs_daemon` lifecycle
- `bdfs-check` — verify host prerequisites

**Windows VM sharing**:
- `bdfs-share` — expose a blend namespace to a Windows VM via virtiofs; automatically pushes `bdfs-mount-shares.ps1` and the share list into the VM if it is running
- `bdfs-unshare` — detach the share from the VM
- `bdfs-list-shares` — list active bdfs virtiofs shares with mount/attach status
- `guest/bdfs-mount-shares.ps1` — PowerShell helper that auto-mounts bdfs shares as drive letters via WinFsp; supports `-All`, `-ShareName`/`-DriveLetter`, `-List`, `-Unmount`
- `iwt vm setup-guest --mount-bdfs-shares` — push the helper and register a Windows logon scheduled task (included in `--all`)

**Maintenance**:
- `bdfs-demote-schedule` — install/remove a systemd timer for automatic recompression of BTRFS upper layer writes; uses `findmnt` to resolve the BTRFS filesystem root correctly even when the blend mount is a nested subvolume
- `bdfs-demote-run` — single demote pass invoked by the timer; skips unchanged subvolumes via timestamp tracking
- `bdfs-remount-all` — re-attach all registered shares after a reboot or daemon crash; supports `--dry-run`

**Observability**:
- `iwt doctor` now checks for bdfs CLI, kernel module, and daemon; warns on stale `shares.state` entries (unmounted blend paths, missing VMs, detached devices) and on active shares with no demote timer

**Configuration** (added to default config):
- `IWT_BDFS_ENABLED=false` — opt-in flag
- `IWT_BDFS_COMPRESSION=zstd` — default compression for export/demote
- `IWT_BDFS_BLEND_MOUNT=/mnt/iwt-blend` — default blend mountpoint

**TUI**: new `bdfs` menu accessible from both the main menu and the VM submenu, covering the full workflow including demote scheduling

**Tests**: 52 new unit tests covering script structure, argument validation, state file handling, CLI dispatch, lib helpers, config defaults, doctor checks, guest setup, and TUI integration
